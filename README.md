# Viking API

## Overview
The Viking API serves as a framework and library of utilities to be used across all Viking Scripts on the [OSBot](https://osbot.org/forum/) platform. This repository
is meant to be included as a submodule in script repositories. This helps to maintain the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle in the various Viking scripts.
